## OS requirements
To install Docker Engine, you need the 64-bit version of one of these Ubuntu versions:

Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS)
Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 (LTS)
Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 (LTS)
Docker Engine is supported on x86_64 (or amd64), armhf, and arm64 architectures.

## Installation methods
You can install Docker Engine in different ways, depending on your needs:

Most users set up Dockerâ€™s repositories and install from them, for ease of installation and upgrade tasks. This is the recommended approach.

Some users download the DEB package and install it manually and manage upgrades completely manually. This is useful in situations such as installing Docker on air-gapped systems with no access to the internet.

In testing and development environments, some users choose to use automated convenience scripts to install Docker.
